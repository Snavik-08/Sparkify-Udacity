## Project Motivation
This project is a final assignment for the Udacity Nanodegree Data Science Program. It includes a scenario were a music stream company with the name sparkify would like to find out what causes customer churn and how it can be identified in future with a train model. The data contains all user interactions with the app for a specific timeframe. Its observations therefore represent the interaction of a user within a usage session. For the training the data was aggregated and group by user id to have an summary over the total user interaction timeline. 
The steps required for the project:
-	EDA of the data to get an overview of potential relevant variables and to identify the churn event
-	Create new aggregated data set that will be used for training
-	Generate models, compare them and optimize them with a CV grid search

## Files
The main file is the jupyter notebook which included all taken steps and additionally the json file were the used data is included.

## Blog Post
To past this project additionally a blog post had to be created where the single steps and findings had to be described. This summary was published on the common platform medium and can be found [here](https://medium.com/@snagviko/prevent-your-customer-from-churning-by-in-depth-data-analysis-and-machine-learning-820e0587a3b8)
